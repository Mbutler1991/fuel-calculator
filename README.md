# Fuel Cost Calculator

This project was ade using Python, Google Sheets, Google Cloud Services and Google Drive api. and it is sued to get an estimate of how much petrol or diesel you need for a journey

This application is aimed at anybody that drives a car as it can be used with MPG for any vehicle it can get an estimate of price for any vehicle and any journey.

The aim is to help people manage their finances better when it comes to their travel costs and to help them with their budget.

I would ideally like to introduce this to motorists by word of mouth and a targetted ad campaign.
